            "If we were to look at the 5-year period between 2014 to 2019, we believe that the rise of Anti-Asian hate crimes is very surprising. However, considering the socioeconomic situation that many Americans today are hindered by COVID-19, it is not surprising to see that Asians in the U.S. are discriminated heavily for being Asian. Compared to Anti-LGBTQ+ or Anti-Black hate crimes (which are more common), Anti-Asian hate crimes are increasing in an exponential rate but minimal compared to other hate crimes."
